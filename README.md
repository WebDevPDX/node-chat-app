#My First Chat App

I plan on building a turn based strategy game that can be played by 2 people over the web.
To how to get real-time communication between 2 players going, I decided to start by building a chat app. I expect a similar
transfer behavior for the game as I am currently sending and receiving JSON strings, which will most likely be the data type
the game will send as well.

However, I see more issues in the near future (for example how to limit the max number of participants to 2 in one game
but allow multiple games of 2 players at the same time) but right now the chat app works and I will have some fun with my
son using it. :)
